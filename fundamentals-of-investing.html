                <ol>
                    <li>Common stocks: Along with proportional ownership of the company and the growth potential, common stocks also offer voting rights to the stockholder, allowing you to speak your piece when it comes to things like management elections or structural business changes.</li>
                    <li>Preferred stocks don't come with voting rights, but they're getting preferred status in the earnings that are paid out to preferred stockholders first.</li>
