                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Stock Basics</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>A stock is a portion of ownership of a company.</li>
            <li>Stocks are also known as shares of a company, or equity investments, and are primarily bought and sold on publicly traded stock exchanges.</li>
            <li>There are 2 common ways that you can earn money through stock ownership.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Value/Capital appreciation</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>They're worth more when the business overall value increases and may also command higher market prices due to demand.</li>
                            <li>That means you can earn money by selling your stock at a profit.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Dividend payments</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Stockholders might earn dividends of a company's profit, which may be paid in cash or in additional stock.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ol>
            <li>Stock market: The stock market is where investors connect to buy and sell investments.</li>
            <li>A stock is a share of ownership of a company which you can purchase electronically.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Understanding Stocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Each share of stock represents a small but equal share in the company.</li>
            <li>The stocks you can buy are in public companies that have registered their stock with The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).</li>
            <li>A diversified portfolio will help to mitigate the risk of being too heavily invested in any one category.</li>
            <li>Stocks are sometimes referred to as equities.</li>
            <li>Owners of stocks are often referred to as stockholders or shareholders.</li>
            <li>Stocks come in 2 varieties, common and preferred.</li>
                <ol>
                    <li>Common stocks: Along with proportional ownership of the company and the growth potential, common stocks also offer voting rights to the stockholder, allowing you to speak your piece when it comes to things like management elections or structural business changes.</li>
                    <li>Preferred stocks don't come with voting rights, but they're getting preferred status in the earnings that are paid out to preferred stockholders first.</li>
                </ol>
            <li>Market capitalization: the market value of a company's publicly traded stock.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Larger companies/cap stocks: older, more established, and less riskier for investors.</li>
                    <li>Smaller companies/cap stocks: often newer, less established, riskier, and more growth potential.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Stocks classified in different style categories:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Value stocks: stocks considered to be under value</li>
                    <li>Growth stocks: companies expected to continue growing at a faster rate than their competitors</li>
                    <li>Dividend investing: a style utilized by investors targeting stocks' ability to produce income or yield high dividends and provide cash flow (e.g., utility and real estate companies)</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <h4>Video: Analyzing Stocks</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>The value of stock is made up of several factors:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>the company's ability to continue making a profit</li>
                    <li>its customer base</li>
                    <li>its financial structure</li>
                    <li>the economy</li>
                    <li>political and cultural trends</li>
                    <li>how the company fits within a broader industry</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Ratios can also offer insight into a company's financial health, allowing for comparisons to other companies in the same industry or against the overall market.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Price to earning ratio (P ratio):</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It divides the market price of a company's stock by the company's earning per share.</li>
                            <li>It can reveal how many years it'll take for a company to generate enough value to buy back its stock.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Price to sales ratio:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It divides the market capitalization of the company by its revenue.</li>
                            <li>It should be as close to one as possible. If it's less than one, it's considered excellent.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Earnings per share (EPS)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is calculated by taking the net income, subtracting any preferred stock dividends, and dividing the result by the total number of outstanding common stock shares.</li>
                            <li>It lets you know how much earnings each shareholder would receive if the company was liquidated immediately.</li>
                            <li>Rising EPS means the company's potential to more money to distribute to shareholders or roll back into the business.</li>
                        </ul>
                    <li>Return on equity (ROE)</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is determined by dividing the company's net income by the shareholder's equity, then multiplying it by 100.</li>
                            <li>It measures the growth and profit of a company.</li>
                            <li>It tells you the value you receive as a shareholder should the company liquidate.</li>
                        </ul>
                </ul>
        </ul>
