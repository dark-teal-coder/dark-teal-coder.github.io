    <h4>Topic 1: Who Should Pay for University Students' Tuition Fees?</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In this time and age, higher education is advancing at an alarming rate. A sizable percentage of people hold the opinion that the government should be responsible for the full tuition of college students. They claim that after graduation, college students will contribute much to the society. However, I am convinced that university students should pay for their tuition fees. There are many reasons supporting my view.
            <br><br>
            The main reason is that it can ensure the quality of college education. If the college students do not pay the tuition fee, it will lay a heavy burden on the government. If the government is unable to invest enough money on university education because of the limited budget, the quality of education cannot be ensured.
            <br><br>
            The second reason for my propensity is that it is quite fair to require students to pay the full tuition. Some high school leavers give up their further study because they have their own life aim. That is to say, going to university is a totally personal choice. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the people who make such choice pay for it.
            <br><br>
            Some people may say that students from the countryside and undeveloped areas cannot go to college if they are required to pay full tuition. It is a great loss to the country as well as a misfortune to students themselves. In fact, there are some feasible methods to solve the problem. The first option is the bank loan, although it may have to be paid back at a later date. In addition, students can work part-time to earn money to cover some expenses.
            <br><br>
            So, as I see it, college students should pay for the full tuition.

    <h4>Topic 2: Effects of Examination on Students</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people think that examinations have some bad effects on students. Some people say they have some good effects on education.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

        <p>
            In the long history of human education, great changes have taken place in every field of study. However, testing a person by examination is still regarded as the only reliable and feasible method to measure one's knowledge and ability. From elementary schools to universities, students have to take many examinations. They even regard examinations as an indispensable part of their life.
            <br><br>
            Some people hold that examinations have negative impacts on students. First of all, examinations are unable to evaluate one's true ability. They can only test memory or the skill of working rapidly under pressure. Secondly, examinations encourage bad study habits. Students tend to lay emphasis on what will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. Finally, examinations lower the standards of teaching. Teachers have to train students exam-taking skills instead of teaching their subjects.
            <br><br>
            Many other people, however, believe examinations have some advantages. In the first place, they serve as a driving force to stimulate students to work hard. Laziness is part of human nature. Without examinations, students tend to ignore their studies. Moreover, the results of examinations are just like mirrors for both students and teachers. Students can assess themselves and teachers can adjust their teaching method according to the information they obtain from examination. Finally, till now no better methods have been discovered to replace examinations. Other forms of assessment are too time-consuming and therefore infeasible.
            <br><br>
            In my opinion, examinations have positive effects on teaching. They make students hard working. They also provide a clear objective standard by which the students can assess themselves and teachers can know what they should do next. Furthermore, at present no better methods are available. Therefore, I am sure examinations will continue to play an essential role in education.

    <h4>Topic 3: The Advantages and Disadvantages of Studying Abroad</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                In recent years, many young people decide to further their study abroad.
                <br><br>
                Do you think the advantages of studying abroad outweigh its disadvantages?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            Over the last several years, along with the rapid development of economy, an increasing number of parents have been sending their children to study abroad. A majority of people hold the view that studying abroad brings students many benefits, while others are of the opinion that students should finish university education in their motherland. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.
            <br><br>
            Those who advocate that studying abroad has a lot of disadvantages have their sound reasons. First of all, living far away from home, students will suffer from loneliness and homesickness. Overseas students often feel disoriented and depressed for lack of adequate knowledge and understanding of the local customs and lifestyle. Secondly, many students do not want to return to their native country after graduation because most of them want to have a more comfortable life and a brighter future overseas. This may result in a serious brain-drain and our country will inevitably incur a huge loss of talents.
            <br><br>
            To this issue, some other people hold a different attitude, arguing that students should go abroad to study. To begin with, it can broaden the students' vision. They get a chance to experience a totally different culture. The knowledge of social customs acquired in other countries helps them become more open-minded. Next, there are academic advantages. Students can learn advanced science and technology. They receive a different education. The book resources are more up-to-date. The professors are aware of all the latest development in their fields. Therefore the standard of teaching is much higher. Moreover, when they finish their study abroad, they will have more choices for their future career. All the above merits are conducive to their self-betterment and self-realisation.
            <br><br>
            For my part, I stand on the latter opinion that while overseas study has its drawbacks, the advantages are more obvious. It can broaden one's horizon. Students have easy access to the first-rate facilities and the latest development in science and technology. In addition, when they finish their study, they have more job opportunities. Therefore, as long as it is financially feasible, an overseas education may do a person more good than harm.
