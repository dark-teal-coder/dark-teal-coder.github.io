    <h4>Topic 1: Who should pay for university students' tuition fees?</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In this time and age, higher education is advancing at an alarming rate. A sizable percentage of people hold the opinion that the government should be responsible for the full tuition of college students. They claim that after graduation, college students will contribute much to the society. However, I am convinced that university students should pay for their tuition fees. There are many reasons supporting my view.
            <br><br>
            The main reason is that it can ensure the quality of college education. If the college students do not pay the tuition fee, it will lay a heavy burden on the government. If the government is unable to invest enough money on university education because of the limited budget, the quality of education cannot be ensured.
            <br><br>
            The second reason for my propensity is that it is quite fair to require students to pay the full tuition. Some high school leavers give up their further study because they have their own life aim. That is to say, going to university is a totally personal choice. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the people who make such choice pay for it.
            <br><br>
            Some people may say that students from the countryside and undeveloped areas cannot go to college if they are required to pay full tuition. It is a great loss to the country as well as a misfortune to students themselves. In fact, there are some feasible methods to solve the problem. The first option is the bank loan, although it may have to be paid back at a later date. In addition, students can work part-time to earn money to cover some expenses.
            <br><br>
            So, as I see it, college students should pay for the full tuition.

            <p>
                Some people think that examinations have some bad effects on students. Some people say they have some good effects on education.

        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In the long history of human education, great changes have taken place in every field of study. However, testing a person by examination is still regarded as the only reliable and feasible method to measure one's knowledge and ability. From elementary schools to universities, students have to take many examinations. They even regard examinations as an indispensable part of their life.
            <br><br>
            Some people hold that examinations have negative impacts on students. First of all, examinations are unable to evaluate one's true ability. They can only test memory or the skill of working rapidly under pressure. Secondly, examinations encourage bad study habits. Students tend to lay emphasis on what will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. Finally, examinations lower the standards of teaching. Teachers have to train students exam-taking skills instead of teaching their subjects.
            <br><br>
            Many other people, however, believe examinations have some advantages. In the first place, they serve as a driving force to stimulate students to work hard. Laziness is part of human nature. Without examinations, students tend to ignore their studies. Moreover, the results of examinations are just like mirrors for both students and teachers. Students can assess themselves and teachers can adjust their teaching method according to the information they obtain from examination. Finally, till now no better methods have been discovered to replace examinations. Other forms of assessment are too time-consuming and therefore infeasible.
            <br><br>
            In my opinion, examinations have positive effects on teaching. They make students hard working. They also provide a clear objective standard by which the students can assess themselves and teachers can know what they should do next. Furthermore, at present no better methods are available. Therefore, I am sure examinations will continue to play an essential role in education.

    <h4>Topic 3: The advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                In recent years, many young people decide to further their study abroad.
                <br><br>
                Do you think the advantages of studying abroad outweigh its disadvantages?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            Over the last several years, along with the rapid development of economy, an increasing number of parents have been sending their children to study abroad. A majority of people hold the view that studying abroad brings students many benefits, while others are of the opinion that students should finish university education in their motherland. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.
            <br><br>
            Those who advocate that studying abroad has a lot of disadvantages have their sound reasons. First of all, living far away from home, students will suffer from loneliness and homesickness. Overseas students often feel disoriented and depressed for lack of adequate knowledge and understanding of the local customs and lifestyle. Secondly, many students do not want to return to their native country after graduation because most of them want to have a more comfortable life and a brighter future overseas. This may result in a serious brain-drain and our country will inevitably incur a huge loss of talents.
            <br><br>
            To this issue, some other people hold a different attitude, arguing that students should go abroad to study. To begin with, it can broaden the students' vision. They get a chance to experience a totally different culture. The knowledge of social customs acquired in other countries helps them become more open-minded. Next, there are academic advantages. Students can learn advanced science and technology. They receive a different education. The book resources are more up-to-date. The professors are aware of all the latest development in their fields. Therefore the standard of teaching is much higher. Moreover, when they finish their study abroad, they will have more choices for their future career. All the above merits are conducive to their self-betterment and self-realisation.
            <br><br>
            For my part, I stand on the latter opinion that while overseas study has its drawbacks, the advantages are more obvious. It can broaden one's horizon. Students have easy access to the first-rate facilities and the latest development in science and technology. In addition, when they finish their study, they have more job opportunities. Therefore, as long as it is financially feasible, an overseas education may do a person more good than harm.

    <h4>Topic 4: The reasons why it is difficult for university graduates to find jobs these days</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Nowadays it is difficult for university graduates to find a job.
                <br><br>
                Analyse the individual and social reasons and offer some solutions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            The job market for college graduates is getting tighter and tighter. According to a survey, in 2005 only 60 percent of college graduates found jobs. Why do college graduates find it increasingly difficult to get jobs? There are some personal and social reasons.
            <br><br>
            Graduates themselves are responsible for the situation. Nowadays university students cannot concentrate on their studies. High technology brings them many interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet and playing games. They are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting their studies. In addition, some graduates set too high salary standard and they are reluctant to seek a job in the less developed areas, where there are many opportunities for success and career development. Furthermore, there is no denying the fact that the students better equipped with practical knowledge are more competitive in job hunting, while those majoring in history, geography and the like have fewer job opportunities.
            <br><br>
            Should students assume all the responsibility? There are some social reasons, one of which is the boom of college graduates. For example, in China, only half of high school graduates were admitted to colleges and universities in 1997, but in 2001 two-thirds of them entered colleges. Obviously we will experience a sharp increase in the number of college graduates. Moreover, the world economy is in depression, which makes the situation of job market worse than ever. Another reason is that there exist some unreasonable employment policies such as sexual discrimination and residence permit restriction.
            <br><br>
            In order to solve the problem, college graduates should spend more time on their learning to improve their academic performance. They also need to have a moderate salary requirement. Meanwhile, the government should encourage the development of the economy to create more job opportunities to young people. All the unreasonable policies should be abolished.

    <h4>Topic 5: Reasons for attending university</h4>

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experience, career preparation, increased knowledge).
                <br><br>
                Why do you think people attend college or university?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            College is a place where students can gain more new knowledge and experience. Of course, different people have different reasons for attending college: some may want to further their study in college; some hope to find a good job while some others wish to exchange their present situation through studying in college. In my opinion, college study can be best defined as a preparation for one's future life.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, students can gain new knowledge and experience from studying in college. Teachers and professors in college who possess not only abundant professional knowledge but also plentiful of teaching experience will supply students with new knowledge and direct them to solve problems in reality. With their help, students can be equipped with knowledge in a specific area, which will pave the road for their future career.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, students can learn how to arrange time efficiently. Before studying in college, their life may often be arranged by their parents, and their study by teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because they will have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have to decide things such as when to get up, when to play, and when to finish their assignment, etc. This experience is of great importance for their work and life in the future.
            <br><br>
            Thirdly, studying in college gives students an opportunity to live with others and learn to cooperate with others. Usually, people feel uncomfortable about living with strangers because of different habits and values. But in the long run, it will turn out good for them because in the process of forcing themselves to cooperate with others and solve problems together, they will learn to care for and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to cooperate with others in society.
            <br><br>
            All in all, students can not only gain lots of new knowledge but also accumulate much more experience, such as how to arrange time and how to cooperate with other people. Therefore, college study serves as an important preparation for their future work and life.

    <h4>Topic 6: Goal of college education</h4>

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Should the goal of college education be to ensure that the students find a good job or should it aim at cultivating the students overall abilities?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            What should be the purpose of college education? No doubt, different people, or even different universities, may see it quite differently. As to me, I tend to support the view that it should aim at cultivating the students' overall abilities.
            <br><br>
            First of all, social progress needs overall developed college graduates in the long run. When we ask ourselves the question: "What kind of college graduates does the society need?" The answer is just too obvious: ones with a good command of the knowledge in their own fields of study, ones with a healthy body, ones with a healthy mentality, ones with good communication skills, ones with teamwork spirit, ones with creative, innovative ability or the ability for implemen-tation. What are all these things? Again, the answer is just simple overall abilities.
            <br><br>
            Second, an overall developed graduate would find a job more easily. You can ask an employer of a certain enterprise: What type of employees do you wish to employ? If this question is a little unclear, we can make it more specific by letting him make a choice: A. an overall developed college graduate; B. a non-overall developed college graduate. Sup-posing every other things remain equal, we have sound reasons to believe that he will defi-nitely select A.
            <br><br>
            Admittedly, it is praiseworthy of universities to be concerned about their graduates' job-hunting issues, for anyone should first solve the problem of making a living before talking about later on development. Besides, it is also the shared aspiration of all college graduates to have a well-paid job that they like and that points to a good prospect in the future. However, no one would ever deny the fact that to cultivate the overall abilities of the students is always closely re-lated to and in no way conflicts or contradicts against good job opportunities.
            <br><br>
            From the foregoing discussion, we can come to the conclusion that the purpose of college education should always target at cultivating the overall abilities of the students.

            <p>
                Some people think that studying in a college or university is the best way for students to prepare for future career. But others think they should leave school as soon as possible to develop their career through work experience.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            While some people think that the best way to get prepared for future career is studying in a college or university, there are others who hold that one should leave school as early as possible and develop his career through work experience. In this essay, I will discuss the two views from the following aspects.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, going to college is very useful. One needs to learn and acquire a lot of fundamental and theoretical knowledge that will prove to be of practical significance in his future career development. In this respect, a college education can well serve as a means to the end. It is not hard to reckon that the theoretical and fundamental knowledge one acquires at college will at least help broaden his vision and horizon and thus give him the edge over those who have not done so.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, one's success, especially financial success, is not determined by whether or not he has been educated in college. It seems that work experience and opportunity play a more important role. I have quite a few friends who merely managed to finish primary or junior high school and went into business right away. Some of them struck rich in a few years and are now managing very large companies which employ over 1,000 workers, most of their employees being college graduates.
            <br><br>
            However, our society is undergoing fast development and changes, thus raising higher and higher requirements for knowledge. In this context, people's education levels gradually reveal their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. So far as employment is concerned, those who have received a college education naturally have more chances than those who have not. And in terms of the new models of achieving success, tremendous fortune is in-creasingly related to the trend of scientific and technological development, fully demonstrat-ing the value of college education.
            <br><br>
            So, even though there are quite some stories of successful people without a college education, we can assert from the development trend of the world that this will become rarer and rarer. Therefore, if one has the chance, it is more advisable for him to go to college.

    <h4>Topic 8: Going directly to university, gaining one year of work experience or traveling</h4>

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people believe that students who want to go to university after graduation from high school should have about one year's time to get a job to obtain work experience or have a travel to enlarge their vision
                <br><br>
                Do you agree or disagree What's your opinion?

        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In most countries, most high school graduates go directly to university. Some people oppose this practice. They claim that students should get a job or have a travel for one year before starting their university education. They argue that, by this way, students can obtain work experience and their sights can be enlarged. However, I doubt whether the arguments could hold much water.
            <br><br>
            First, it is a waste of time. Since students are in their formative years, the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our nation. The knowledge and skills which they have gained in high school are surely inadequate. Compared with studying, working and traveling, to some extent, are more relaxing and less painstaking, so after one-year exciting experience outside campus, some young people tend to give up their learning. At least, they cannot concentrate on their studies. It is a great loss to themselves as well as a great misfortune for our country.
            <br><br>
            Second, young students may be hurt psychologically. The job or the trip may expose then to social ills at an age when they cannot differentiate good from bad. Their early contact with the complicated society makes them more easily contaminated by unwholesome influence. For example, they maybe become money-oriented.
            <br><br>
            Finally, studying in university can also enrich their social experience and widen their vision. The university is a small society so university students have to communicate with teachers, peers and other people and they have to deal with some problems. During holidays, they can find part-time jobs and go out to travel.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, students should continue their studies after graduation from high school. Social experience can be gained after finishing their studies.
