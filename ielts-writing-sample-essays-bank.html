    <h4>Topic 1: Who should pay for university students' tuition fees?</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In this time and age, higher education is advancing at an alarming rate. A sizable percentage of people hold the opinion that the government should be responsible for the full tuition of college students. They claim that after graduation, college students will contribute much to the society. However, I am convinced that university students should pay for their tuition fees. There are many reasons supporting my view.
            <br><br>
            The main reason is that it can ensure the quality of college education. If the college students do not pay the tuition fee, it will lay a heavy burden on the government. If the government is unable to invest enough money on university education because of the limited budget, the quality of education cannot be ensured.
            <br><br>
            The second reason for my propensity is that it is quite fair to require students to pay the full tuition. Some high school leavers give up their further study because they have their own life aim. That is to say, going to university is a totally personal choice. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the people who make such choice pay for it.
            <br><br>
            Some people may say that students from the countryside and undeveloped areas cannot go to college if they are required to pay full tuition. It is a great loss to the country as well as a misfortune to students themselves. In fact, there are some feasible methods to solve the problem. The first option is the bank loan, although it may have to be paid back at a later date. In addition, students can work part-time to earn money to cover some expenses.
            <br><br>
            So, as I see it, college students should pay for the full tuition.

        <p>
            In the long history of human education, great changes have taken place in every field of study. However, testing a person by examination is still regarded as the only reliable and feasible method to measure one's knowledge and ability. From elementary schools to universities, students have to take many examinations. They even regard examinations as an indispensable part of their life.
            <br><br>
            Some people hold that examinations have negative impacts on students. First of all, examinations are unable to evaluate one's true ability. They can only test memory or the skill of working rapidly under pressure. Secondly, examinations encourage bad study habits. Students tend to lay emphasis on what will be tested. They are encouraged to memorize rather than to think. Finally, examinations lower the standards of teaching. Teachers have to train students exam-taking skills instead of teaching their subjects.
            <br><br>
            Many other people, however, believe examinations have some advantages. In the first place, they serve as a driving force to stimulate students to work hard. Laziness is part of human nature. Without examinations, students tend to ignore their studies. Moreover, the results of examinations are just like mirrors for both students and teachers. Students can assess themselves and teachers can adjust their teaching method according to the information they obtain from examination. Finally, till now no better methods have been discovered to replace examinations. Other forms of assessment are too time-consuming and therefore infeasible.
            <br><br>
            In my opinion, examinations have positive effects on teaching. They make students hard working. They also provide a clear objective standard by which the students can assess themselves and teachers can know what they should do next. Furthermore, at present no better methods are available. Therefore, I am sure examinations will continue to play an essential role in education.

    <h4>Topic 3: The advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad</h4>
    <div class="essay">
        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                In recent years, many young people decide to further their study abroad.
                <br><br>
                Do you think the advantages of studying abroad outweigh its disadvantages?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            Over the last several years, along with the rapid development of economy, an increasing number of parents have been sending their children to study abroad. A majority of people hold the view that studying abroad brings students many benefits, while others are of the opinion that students should finish university education in their motherland. It is quite natural that people from different backgrounds may have divergent attitudes towards it.
            <br><br>
            Those who advocate that studying abroad has a lot of disadvantages have their sound reasons. First of all, living far away from home, students will suffer from loneliness and homesickness. Overseas students often feel disoriented and depressed for lack of adequate knowledge and understanding of the local customs and lifestyle. Secondly, many students do not want to return to their native country after graduation because most of them want to have a more comfortable life and a brighter future overseas. This may result in a serious brain-drain and our country will inevitably incur a huge loss of talents.
            <br><br>
            To this issue, some other people hold a different attitude, arguing that students should go abroad to study. To begin with, it can broaden the students' vision. They get a chance to experience a totally different culture. The knowledge of social customs acquired in other countries helps them become more open-minded. Next, there are academic advantages. Students can learn advanced science and technology. They receive a different education. The book resources are more up-to-date. The professors are aware of all the latest development in their fields. Therefore the standard of teaching is much higher. Moreover, when they finish their study abroad, they will have more choices for their future career. All the above merits are conducive to their self-betterment and self-realisation.
            <br><br>
            For my part, I stand on the latter opinion that while overseas study has its drawbacks, the advantages are more obvious. It can broaden one's horizon. Students have easy access to the first-rate facilities and the latest development in science and technology. In addition, when they finish their study, they have more job opportunities. Therefore, as long as it is financially feasible, an overseas education may do a person more good than harm.

    <h4>Topic 4: The reasons why it is difficult for university graduates to find jobs these days</h4>

            <p>
                Nowadays it is difficult for university graduates to find a job.
                <br><br>

        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            The job market for college graduates is getting tighter and tighter. According to a survey, in 2005 only 60 percent of college graduates found jobs. Why do college graduates find it increasingly difficult to get jobs? There are some personal and social reasons.
            <br><br>
            Graduates themselves are responsible for the situation. Nowadays university students cannot concentrate on their studies. High technology brings them many interesting things which can easily attract their attention such as watching TV, surfing the Internet and playing games. They are addicted to these activities, totally neglecting their studies. In addition, some graduates set too high salary standard and they are reluctant to seek a job in the less developed areas, where there are many opportunities for success and career development. Furthermore, there is no denying the fact that the students better equipped with practical knowledge are more competitive in job hunting, while those majoring in history, geography and the like have fewer job opportunities.
            <br><br>
            Should students assume all the responsibility? There are some social reasons, one of which is the boom of college graduates. For example, in China, only half of high school graduates were admitted to colleges and universities in 1997, but in 2001 two-thirds of them entered colleges. Obviously we will experience a sharp increase in the number of college graduates. Moreover, the world economy is in depression, which makes the situation of job market worse than ever. Another reason is that there exist some unreasonable employment policies such as sexual discrimination and residence permit restriction.
            <br><br>
            In order to solve the problem, college graduates should spend more time on their learning to improve their academic performance. They also need to have a moderate salary requirement. Meanwhile, the government should encourage the development of the economy to create more job opportunities to young people. All the unreasonable policies should be abolished.

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                People attend college or university for many different reasons (for example, new experience, career preparation, increased knowledge).
                <br><br>
                Why do you think people attend college or university?
            </p>

        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            College is a place where students can gain more new knowledge and experience. Of course, different people have different reasons for attending college: some may want to further their study in college; some hope to find a good job while some others wish to exchange their present situation through studying in college. In my opinion, college study can be best defined as a preparation for one's future life.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, students can gain new knowledge and experience from studying in college. Teachers and professors in college who possess not only abundant professional knowledge but also plentiful of teaching experience will supply students with new knowledge and direct them to solve problems in reality. With their help, students can be equipped with knowledge in a specific area, which will pave the road for their future career.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, students can learn how to arrange time efficiently. Before studying in college, their life may often be arranged by their parents, and their study by teachers. It is very different for them to live and study in college, because they will have to arrange their life and study by themselves. They have to decide things such as when to get up, when to play, and when to finish their assignment, etc. This experience is of great importance for their work and life in the future.
            <br><br>
            Thirdly, studying in college gives students an opportunity to live with others and learn to cooperate with others. Usually, people feel uncomfortable about living with strangers because of different habits and values. But in the long run, it will turn out good for them because in the process of forcing themselves to cooperate with others and solve problems together, they will learn to care for and understand other people. It is a preparation for students to cooperate with others in society.
            <br><br>
            All in all, students can not only gain lots of new knowledge but also accumulate much more experience, such as how to arrange time and how to cooperate with other people. Therefore, college study serves as an important preparation for their future work and life.

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Should the goal of college education be to ensure that the students find a good job or should it aim at cultivating the students overall abilities?
            </p>
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            What should be the purpose of college education? No doubt, different people, or even different universities, may see it quite differently. As to me, I tend to support the view that it should aim at cultivating the students' overall abilities.
            <br><br>
            First of all, social progress needs overall developed college graduates in the long run. When we ask ourselves the question: "What kind of college graduates does the society need?" The answer is just too obvious: ones with a good command of the knowledge in their own fields of study, ones with a healthy body, ones with a healthy mentality, ones with good communication skills, ones with teamwork spirit, ones with creative, innovative ability or the ability for implemen-tation. What are all these things? Again, the answer is just simple overall abilities.
            <br><br>
            Second, an overall developed graduate would find a job more easily. You can ask an employer of a certain enterprise: What type of employees do you wish to employ? If this question is a little unclear, we can make it more specific by letting him make a choice: A. an overall developed college graduate; B. a non-overall developed college graduate. Sup-posing every other things remain equal, we have sound reasons to believe that he will defi-nitely select A.
            <br><br>
            Admittedly, it is praiseworthy of universities to be concerned about their graduates' job-hunting issues, for anyone should first solve the problem of making a living before talking about later on development. Besides, it is also the shared aspiration of all college graduates to have a well-paid job that they like and that points to a good prospect in the future. However, no one would ever deny the fact that to cultivate the overall abilities of the students is always closely re-lated to and in no way conflicts or contradicts against good job opportunities.
            <br><br>
            From the foregoing discussion, we can come to the conclusion that the purpose of college education should always target at cultivating the overall abilities of the students.

                Some people think that studying in a college or university is the best way for students to prepare for future career. But others think they should leave school as soon as possible to develop their career through work experience.

        <p>
            While some people think that the best way to get prepared for future career is studying in a college or university, there are others who hold that one should leave school as early as possible and develop his career through work experience. In this essay, I will discuss the two views from the following aspects.
            <br><br>
            Firstly, going to college is very useful. One needs to learn and acquire a lot of fundamental and theoretical knowledge that will prove to be of practical significance in his future career development. In this respect, a college education can well serve as a means to the end. It is not hard to reckon that the theoretical and fundamental knowledge one acquires at college will at least help broaden his vision and horizon and thus give him the edge over those who have not done so.
            <br><br>
            Secondly, one's success, especially financial success, is not determined by whether or not he has been educated in college. It seems that work experience and opportunity play a more important role. I have quite a few friends who merely managed to finish primary or junior high school and went into business right away. Some of them struck rich in a few years and are now managing very large companies which employ over 1,000 workers, most of their employees being college graduates.
            <br><br>
            However, our society is undergoing fast development and changes, thus raising higher and higher requirements for knowledge. In this context, people's education levels gradually reveal their corresponding advantages and disadvantages. So far as employment is concerned, those who have received a college education naturally have more chances than those who have not. And in terms of the new models of achieving success, tremendous fortune is in-creasingly related to the trend of scientific and technological development, fully demonstrat-ing the value of college education.
            <br><br>
            So, even though there are quite some stories of successful people without a college education, we can assert from the development trend of the world that this will become rarer and rarer. Therefore, if one has the chance, it is more advisable for him to go to college.

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people believe that students who want to go to university after graduation from high school should have about one year's time to get a job to obtain work experience or have a travel to enlarge their vision
                <br><br>
                Do you agree or disagree What's your opinion?

        <h5>Sample Essay</h5>
        <p>
            In most countries, most high school graduates go directly to university. Some people oppose this practice. They claim that students should get a job or have a travel for one year before starting their university education. They argue that, by this way, students can obtain work experience and their sights can be enlarged. However, I doubt whether the arguments could hold much water.
            <br><br>
            First, it is a waste of time. Since students are in their formative years, the main task of students is to study hard and learn what is needed for the development of our nation. The knowledge and skills which they have gained in high school are surely inadequate. Compared with studying, working and traveling, to some extent, are more relaxing and less painstaking, so after one-year exciting experience outside campus, some young people tend to give up their learning. At least, they cannot concentrate on their studies. It is a great loss to themselves as well as a great misfortune for our country.
            <br><br>
            Second, young students may be hurt psychologically. The job or the trip may expose then to social ills at an age when they cannot differentiate good from bad. Their early contact with the complicated society makes them more easily contaminated by unwholesome influence. For example, they maybe become money-oriented.
            <br><br>
            Finally, studying in university can also enrich their social experience and widen their vision. The university is a small society so university students have to communicate with teachers, peers and other people and they have to deal with some problems. During holidays, they can find part-time jobs and go out to travel.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, students should continue their studies after graduation from high school. Social experience can be gained after finishing their studies.

            <p>
                Some people believe that a college or university education should be available to all students. Others believe that higher education should be available only to good students.

            There is no denying that a college or university education is very beneficial. Those who receive higher education have more opportunities. They often hold better jobs, earn a higher income and enjoy a more comfortable and secure lifestyle. Unfortunately, places in university are often limited and reserved for "good" students. It is my belief that this practice is not only detrimental to those "bad" students, but to the society as a whole. Therefore, higher education should be available to all students.
            <br><br>
            One reason that higher education should not be limited to good students is that not all sec-ondary students study in equal circumstances. The facilities and teaching at some high schools are superior to those at others, and the students who study there enjoy a great ad-vantage. In addition, a student's performance can be affected by his or her home environ-ment or family financial pressure. It is often more difficult for a student from a disadvan-taged environment and school district to perform well. However, this does not mean that the students would not appreciate and benefit from higher education if given the opportunity
            <br><br>
            Another reason for making higher education available to all is to encourage less capable students to improve. If marginal students believe that they have no hope of entering university, they may feel that there is no point in studying diligently. However, if they see a more direct relationship between their academic performance and their future opportunities, they will be more motivated. In this way, a poor student may turn out to be a good one.
            <br><br>
            Finally, a better educated population contributes to the growth and prosperity of a society as a whole. For this reason, it is advantageous to educate as many young people as possible. Furthermore, by denying higher education to students who do not make their mark in their secondary education, the country may be ignoring a future Einstein. When every person in the society is given the opportunity to reach his or her full potential, the society will benefit.
            <br><br>
            For all of these reasons, I believe that higher education should be available to all students, not only to those with good academic performance in high school. Of course, it is desirable to encourage good performance in students. This can be done by offering financial support in the form of scholarships to those who work hard. In this way, we can ensure that students have the ability to take advantage of the opportunities available to them.

            Recently, parents tend to attach greater importance to their children's education. Some parents hold the opinion that the school has the main duty to educate their children. How-ever, some teachers take the view that parents should also assume the responsibility. Views on this issue vary from person to person.
            <br><br>
            People who hold the opinion that the school should shoulder the major responsibility to educate children have some sound reasons. In the first place, most of the children's waking time is spent in schools, and their purpose to attend school is to receive education. Secondly, the parents pay for the education of their children, so they have the rights to receive correspondent services. As an institution of education, the school has the sole responsibility to educate the younger generation. Moreover, there are well-equipped facilities and welltrained teachers in schools.
            <br><br>
            However, the other side of the coin voices its strong opposition, saying that the parents should assume the main duty of children's education, First of all, the parents know their children more than the school, and they know what to teach and in what way can it be accepted. In the second place, it is beneficial to teach children in accordance with their specific features. Furthermore, in school, each child gets inadequate individual attention, and sometimes his or her particular needs are passed over.

            Admittedly, there are merits to both arguments. From my own perspective, I would like to take a more balanced position. Schools and parents are both essential to children's all-around development and they should take the responsibility together.

    <h4>Topic 11: A boarding school or a day school</h4>

        <h5>Question</h5>
        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Some people think young children can have better education in a boarding school far from home, while others claim that a day school is a better one.
                <br><br>
                Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.

            When asked what kind of school, a boarding or day school, is better for young children's education, some people think a boarding school is more desirable while some prefer a day school.
            <br><br>
            Those for a boarding school are justified, I think, in holding that children can learn to be in-dependent earlier when they are far away from home at an early age. Being away from home, young children are less likely to be spoiled by their parents or grandparents. They have to care for themselves, like washing clothes, buying necessities of life, etc. They also think that living in a boarding school, together with people of the same age, is greatly bene-ficial to the building-up of children's personality. Young children can learn what cannot be learned at home, such as getting on well with others, the idea of cooperation, collectivism, and caring for others.
            <br><br>
            However, those for a day school think quite the opposite. They argue that family education is also very important in addition to school education because family care and love amount to much in the development of children's personality, particularly in their childhood. There will be some psychological defects in a person, like being indifferent, unsociable, and cruel, if he does not enjoy enough family care and parental love during the formation of his charac-fer. The second reason is that young children need parents' supervision and guidance be-cause they are still not mature enough to restrain themselves. Although teachers play a part, they cannot spare enough attention for each student.
            <br><br>
            As far as I am concerned, I think there is truth in the arguments of these two parties. I would like to have a balanced view-a day school and home living are good for children in their childhood. When they are old enough to go to high school, it will be more desirable for them to go to a boarding school.

            <p>
                Nowadays, more and more students are entering private schools. Some people even argue that compared with public schools, private ones are more important.
                <br><br>
                To what extent do you agree or disagree?

        <p>
            These days, there is a growing tendency for students to enter private schools. A large number of people hold the opinion that private schools play a more important role in education than public schools. Other people, however, hold the opinion that public schools offer their children more advantages. For my part, I think both public schools and private schools are indispensable to our society.
            <br><br>
            On one hand, it is increasingly acknowledged that private schools, with their unique characteristics can provide their students with more practical skills, which makes them more competitive in the job market. Generally speaking, a private school is renowned for certain fields of study, such as law or medicine in which many eminent authorities serve as tutors. In general, private schools, financed mainly through contributions and high tuition fees, have plenty of funds to invest in advanced teaching facilities, which can make the students' lives and studies more convenient and comfortable. But, at the same time, high tuition fees are an obstacle for gifted but poor students.
            <br><br>
            On the other hand, the great contributions of public schools cannot be ignored. Poor students have easier access to the public schools that are supported by the government. Schools, ideally, should provide profound, systematic learning of various subjects. The public school that provides wide-ranging subjects for the students is ideal for such training. Furthermore, since education has been more and more emphasised nowadays, the government will, undoubtedly, invest more money in public schools.
            <br><br>
            From what has been discussed above, we may safely draw the conclusion that both public schools and private schools are necessary to train young people for our country's development and construction.

        <div class="question">
            <p>
                Students at universities often have a choice of places to live. They may choose to live in university dormitories, or they may choose to live in apartments in the community.
                <br><br>
                Compare the advantages of living in university housing with the advantages of living in an apartment in the community.

                Where would you prefer to live?

            At most universities there is a variety of housing options for students to choose from. Two of the most common ones are university dormitories and off-campus apartments. Each of these options has its advantages, so students should make their decisions carefully.
            <br><br>
            When moving into a university dormitory, students will find the following advantages. First, it is usually located on the campus and so it is very convenient for students to get to their classes, the library, and other university facilities. They will save the time that they would have otherwise spent commuting to campus. Second, living in a campus dormitory offers students a convenient life. They do not have to worry about cooking meals or paying utility bills on time because all these services are included. They will be able to devote more time to their studies and extracurricular activities. Finally, living in a dormitory makes it easy for students to meet others and develop friendships. In addition to sharing living and recreation space, students can meet others through activities organised by the university or the dormitory itself. This is especially helpful to new students.
            <br><br>
            As for off-campus apartments, there are also several advantages. First of all, living away from the university allows students to develop more independence. Having more responsibility for their daily needs when they are students, they may find it easier to adjust to life on their own after graduation. In addition, the more independent lifestyle offers more freedom. Without university restrictions, the students can keep their own hours and set their own limits. Finally, students who live off-campus have more personal space. They do not have to share their bedrooms or bathrooms with many other people. This may allow them to better relax when they are not in class.
            <br><br>
            In conclusion, both university dormitories and off-campus apartments offer certain advantages to students. Which one to choose depends on what is important to the student. As for me, I would choose to live in a university dormitory for the first year. This would allow me to make friends and get accustomed to school life without the distraction of having to worry about my daily needs. Later, I would move into an off-campus apartment in order to develop my independence and enjoy a freer lifestyle.

                Is it better for students to live at home with their parents or in school accommodations?
                <br><br>

            Many parents would like to spend more money sending their children to boarding schools so that they can receive a better education. However, there are many others who prefer to let their kids stay at home. In my point of view, it is better for students to live in school accommodations.
            <br><br>
            In the first place, living in school accommodations can cultivate students' ability to live Independently. Students have to deal with many problems when they live on campus, such as learning how to adapt to a new environment and how to get along with other people. For instance, I began to live in boarding school since high school. Though at first I found it difficult to live alone, I gradually became open-minded and understood how to solve different problems on my own. These benefited me a lot in my later career life. I acquired many interpersonal communication skills and knowledge through living in school.
            <br><br>
            Furthermore, living on campus can broaden our vision and horizon. Living in school accommodations, we are closer to many other students coming from various parts of the country and with diversified cultural backgrounds. Communicating with them enables us to learn from one another and make progress together. Unavoidably, we will be faced with some different opinions. Nevertheless, it is these counterviews that make us learn more.
            <br><br>
            Of course, everything has two sides. Likewise, living in school also has its drawbacks. For example, students will have to be confronted with many psychological problems, for they ften feel lonely and helpless in a new environment. However, these experiences may be omething beneficial to their future development.
            <br><br>
            Therefore, living in school has more advantages than living at home with parents.
