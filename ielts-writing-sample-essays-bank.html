    <h4>Topic 1: Who should pay for university students' tuition fees?</h4>
    <section>        
        <div>
            Some people say university students should pay for their tuition fees. Some others say the government should pay for the tuition fees.
            <br>
            Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
        </div>
        <h5>Sample Answer</h5>
        <p>
            In this time and age, higher education is advancing at an alarming rate. A sizable percentage of people hold the opinion that the government should be responsible for the full tuition of college students. They claim that after graduation, college students will contribute much to the society. However, I am convinced that university students should pay for their tuition fees. There are many reasons supporting my view.
            <br>
            The main reason is that it can ensure the quality of college education. If the college students do not pay the tuition fee, it will lay a heavy burden on the government. If the government is unable to invest enough money on university education because of the limited budget, the quality of education cannot be ensured.
            <br>
            The second reason for my propensity is that it is quite fair to require students to pay the full tuition. Some high school leavers give up their further study because they have their own life aim. That is to say, going to university is a totally personal choice. Therefore, it is not unreasonable that the people who make such choice pay for it.
            <br>
            Some people may say that students from the countryside and undeveloped areas cannot go to college if they are required to pay full tuition. It is a great loss to the country as well as a misfortune to students themselves. In fact, there are some feasible methods to solve the problem. The first option is the bank loan, although it may have to be paid back at a later date. In addition, students can work part-time to earn money to cover some expenses.
            <br>
            So, as I see it, college students should pay for the full tuition.
